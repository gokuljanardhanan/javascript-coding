Dynamic Programming (DP): An Introduction

Dynamic Programming is a problem-solving technique used in computer science and mathematics to solve problems by breaking them into smaller overlapping subproblems. It involves storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

DP is particularly effective for optimization problems where:

1. The problem can be divided into smaller subproblems (overlapping subproblems).
2. The subproblems have optimal substructure (the solution to the larger problem can be built from the solutions to the subproblems).

There are two main approaches to implementing DP:

1. Top-Down Approach (Memoization): Solve the problem recursively and store the results of solved subproblems in a table to reuse them.
2. Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation): Solve the problem iteratively by solving all subproblems in a specific order and storing the results in a table.

Steps to Solve a DP Problem

1. Define the Problem: Clearly state the problem and identify the constraints.
2. Identify Subproblems: Break the problem into smaller subproblems.
3. Formulate a Recurrence Relation: Write a mathematical expression or formula to relate the solution of a larger problem to its subproblems.
4. Choose an Approach: Decide whether to use memoization or tabulation.
5. Implement the Solution: Write the code to solve the problem using DP.
