Testing

Introduction
Overview
Unit Testing : Testing a small part of web application (Component)
Integration Testing : Testing the integration of multiple components (clicking left/right arrow on horizontal product listing)
Functional Testing : Testing the functionality (Clicking add to cart and checking cart items)
E2E Testing : Testing an end to end flow user done (from login to purchase a product)
Regression Testing : A new feature shouldnt break anything existing
Performance Testing : Performance metric testing and make sure performance value not decreased.
Accessibility Testing : Make sure accessibility values not decreased
Cross-Browser Testing
Usability Testing : Testing whether the feature works fine, and how easily the user is able to use the web application.
Security Testing : make sure Security of web application not compromised
Localization & internationalization Testing
A/B Testing : Comparing 2 versions of web applications and identifying which one performs well.
Unit testing
Testing a small unit of web application. Create a file with .test in name or add test files inside **tests** folder. This format is called dunder. When running the test case command, jest check all the files with .test or the **tests** folder and get all test methods. We have to pass a name and callback method for the test function.

Component testing: Testing a component in react/angular, it similar to unit testing, testing a small unit of react which is a component.
Integration testing: Testing multiple components integration, eg: clicking add to cart and cart component.
Automation and E2E Testing
Puppeteer is a Node.js library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Firefox over the DevTools Protocol or WebDriver BiDi. Puppeteer runs in the headless (no visible UI) by default but can be configured to run in a visible ("headful") browser.

E2e : Testing an entire flow of a user.
CRON job to automate e2e test cases and Amazon SES to send emails.

A/B Testing
A/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a web page, app feature, or marketing asset against each other to determine which one performs better. By randomly assigning users to either the "A" version (the control) or the "B" version (the variation), you can measure and analyze the impact of changes on user behavior.

Eg: A feature or change shown to a set of users and based on the output, making it live for 100%. The user splitting can be done based on userid, location, device type …etc and in client side based on the user set, show different contents, and push the data in analytics. Compare the output and make the better live for 100%.

Performance Testing
Performance testing is used to identify the how fast web page loads, SEO rankings , bounce rate

Check performance tab in developer tab, and analyze waterfall
Lighthouse tab in developer tab

Test driven Development
Write test cases before writing code.
When test cases are added after development, they are just added to justify , In order to write better code first write every test case, and then make them fail initially. Then Start fixing test cases by writing code. Finally refactor the code as required.

Red : Write all test cases and make them fail initially
Green : Start writing code to fix test cases
Refactor : Refactor the code as required

Security Testing
Tool: https://portswigger.net/burp

For using proxy https :
Proxy -> open browser -> navigate to http://burpsuite/ -> download certificate -> browser settings -> privacy and security -> manage certificates - > Add certificate downloaded -> always trust

Burp -> intercept on

Once proxying with burp suite is enabled, All the request going from browser will go through it and we can have options to update http request , and also create multiple requests together (for attacking).
